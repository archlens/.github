ArchLens ([GitHub](https://github.com/archlens)) is a project that aims to help developers **keep track of the evolution of the structure of their systems** by allowing them to quickly define module views and then visualizing their evolution. 

It consists of three components:
- [Python CLI tool](https://github.com/archlens/ArchLens) -- generates module views from specs
- [GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/archlens/Render-Diff-on-PR) -- uses the CLI tool under to generate architectural diff views and insert them into every PR
- [VS Code Extension](https://github.com/archlens/ArchLens-VsCode-Extension) -- live interactive diagrams in the IDE -- one can jump from individual dependencies to source code 

A [vision paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zbcctdmkbgpv#b4ce30) is written by Mircea about the project.
